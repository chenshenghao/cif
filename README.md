# Free Chinese localization project for Indie Game 
### *Author FCIG project*
------
## What is FCIG project?
> If you are developer or publisher of Indie games, we localize your *FIRST* game from English to Chinese __WITHOUT ANY CHARGE__.

## Why do you do this for free?
> Our project members are veteran gamers and professional localizers. We have insights on game localization and know the localization pains of individual developer. We want great indie game become known in China.

## Who are we?
> We are translator, reviewer, and project manager from a first tier company with the same habit in game. Every of us has 1,000,000+ words of translation experience.

## What shall I do?
> Prepare any files you need to localize including string files and images, [contact us](mailto:chshh@yeah.net), and actively cooperate.

## How long would you take for localizing a game?
> It depends on the translatable string volume and our free time. Generally, we can complete translation and testing works for __TWO__ games a year. So if you expect your Chinese version anxiously, please find domestic localization companies or contact for business cooperation.

## Do you localize all games?
> It depends on whether we have an ongoing project, and whether our members are familiar with certain game genre. 

## Will you seriously localizing my game in free?
> __Yes__. You can expect that the translation is certainly __NOT Machine Translation__. If you provide key for us, we will guarantee at least 8 hours of testing before we start translation. And your help is meaningful when we can't determine an accurate translation for strings.

## I want my game to be translated into more languages besides Chinese. Can you help?
> FCIG project currently focuses on China market. We will consider providing more languages if the project run well.

## I would like to compensate you somehow for the good translation...
> Great! Whatever you think suitable, list us as contributors, a letter of recommendation, game key, business cooperation in future game etc.
